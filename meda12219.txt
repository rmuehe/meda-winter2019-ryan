TODAY
Beginning to Build an app from scratch
HTML Generator
- only buttons required for input

MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node
- stack does everything: MVC
database, actions/events (controller), interface (view)
-- lot of forms
-- lot of buttons
-- lot of POST handles
- messy in the front-end: using jQuery

backend
- using a login, 
(not secure, otherwise need cookies, sessions, hash [which ed doesn't have exp. with in JS])
- 

can't reuse what we use on the backend with React...
- React is a "dialect" for JavaScript

"scope creep" : every iteration needs "more"
- never done with the project...
- avoiding: take notes about future features.
-- finish what you started now for the time being.

Defining HTML Generator

- Forms
- H1, H2

- build HTML page
[[maybe translate markdown to html]]
-- filename
-- download HTML file
-- allow titles, headers, text, images+ 
-- (uploading, passing files to server requires some practice)
- Save feature: save project, 
- load project with user login
OPTIONAL
- live preview window (if there's time)+
- tables ++
- pre-built gallery themes (later)
- add color/style

- Drag and Drop, or auto-generation: 
- may be too advanced SquareSpace, Wix, Weebly

Visualizing the HTML Generator
- let's say there's three pages

VIEW
1st page: 

Login
UserName, Password fields
Submit button
Reset button

-----------
Register
email
username
password
Submit button
Reset button (for convenience and accessibility)

//////////////////

2nd page:

Build Webpage
- avoiding checkboxes, radio buttons (harder to code)
- maybe: table of contents, toolbar (icons like on MSPAINT)

jQuery UI, jQuery plugin -- good for drag/drop functionality
jqueryui.com/draggable

NAV BAR
ToolBar in a column
-customize text
-download, save buttons
Structure
- header
- ptag
- link	````````````````````````````````````````````````1


//////////////////

3rd Page
profile/control panel
- append, delete files, change user information, logout button
- list of projects
- account settings (date joined)
-- Need Canvas to make thumbnails....


- create a gmail account, npm package for sending emails....

CONTROL
- hardest part of MVC (?)

MODEL
- Database

What data:
-- Projects
--- Images

-- Credentials
--- Account information


Save images in database
- used to happen more years before
Alternatively: save a filepath in the database
- downside: file not found when path changes

Controller -> View -> Model

MODEL
What is a schema?
- A layout of how the data is stored
- structure of the documents

Project Schema			Account Schema
- filename				- fname		strings
- array of elements		- lname		  |
-- (html objects)			- username		  |
- owner's username			- email		  v
-- (insecure, but ok for now)	- password

Model in Mongoose: How you contact (connect with?) MongoDB server

CONTROLLER
- controls the data
- conditions, functions, ... control the flow of the program
- List of Actions
-- sequence of methods, variables, Loops

ACTIONS
1st Page login/register
- Sign In
- Register

2nd Page build webpage
- Save
- Download
-- Generates into a HTML file from Data (JSON perhaps) 
- Create HTML code

3rd Page profile/control panel
- Logout
- update password
- CRUD for projects

(Will look into sessions, but not cookies here)

"nvm" recommended for mac users : manage a node install

Terminal CMDS for building HTMLGenerator node project
npm install
npm install -S express
npm install -S mongoose

folders: 
assets: CSS, JS, images, txt files
- builder-images, user-avatars
client
- images, styles, script folder; index, builder, profile.html files
